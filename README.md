# About
an Ads Metrics table in React

# Getting started
Install dependancies with `npm install`

Build app with `npm run build`.

Start server with `npm start` and open http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

# Bonus
There is a refactored version on the branch `routes-ajax-refactor` that requests
the Ads data and Ads Metrics data from their respective routes. Moved the
`<Table>` component into its own component, and did AJAX calls in root `<App>`
component, passing data down via props.
